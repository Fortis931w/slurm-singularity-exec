Simple Slurm SPANK plugin to select a user-space (container) for the job 
invocation.

Currently, the plugin is a proof-of-concept implementation.

## Installation

```sh
sudo make install
```

If you want to install the plugin and script to a different location use e.g.:
```sh
sudo make libdir=/etc/slurm/spank install
```
